--------------------------- 
Only one script in the scene can have a function command.
You must declare the QuickCmd Namespace and attach the Command attribute.
Parameters should be of a simple type, such as int, float, bool, and string, which can be entered as text.

There are also times when I want to see my own variables on the screen.
In that case, use Quickcommand.SendWatch (string key, object value).
The value is output above the log to match the key.


When you write down a function name, 
help appears in order of the relevant name, 
select the command up and down the arrow keys, 
and press Tab to complete automatically.
If there is a parameter, you can separate it by floating a space.

Click E to clear the log cleanly.
Click X to close the window.
You can open a window in a mobile environment by double-clicking the transparent button on the bottom left.
You can activate and toggle the window by pressing Ctrl + '.
You can check all executable functions with the /help command.
